What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
  I was not fully understanding the full scope of git/github workflow and how they worked together, especially bringing another coder into the mix.
What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
  This GPS helped me to better understand what it looks like to work with a collaborator on the same repo. I understand more about how to merge changes locally versus pushing changes to GitHub.
What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
  We asked our guide more about what it looks like to clone a repo that somebody else has already been working in. We also asked him about merging errors, as we had a hard time at first actually creating the errors we were supposed to merge.
What still confuses you about Git?
  I don't know that I'd really say that I'm confused by git per say. I just think I understand it more and more each time I use it. For example, I finished week 1's assignments yesterday and moved onto week 2's assignments today. I worked more in git today and realized that I actually did know how to run the git workflow.
How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
  I enjoyed my first experience paring with a guide! I was a little nervous going in, because I didn't fully know what to expect. However, I think Erika and I did a good job working together, and Blake was a great guide. He didn't interject too much, but he understood when we needed help. I appreciated that.
